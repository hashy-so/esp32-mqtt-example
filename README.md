For mqtt, you need a few certificates to speak to the server, which are for each unique device.
I can provide these certs + the endpoint URL. I can also provide access to our AWS console if you want.

Each message you send has a topic and a payload. We should agree on a topic for each type of message. The payload can be anything.
